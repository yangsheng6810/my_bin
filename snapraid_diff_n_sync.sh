# This is a helper script that keeps snapraid parity info in sync with
# your data and optionally verifies the parity info. Here's how it works:
#   1) Shuts down configured services
#   2) Calls diff to figure out if the parity info is out of sync.
#   3) If parity info is out of sync, AND the number of deleted or changed files exceed
#      X (each configurable), it triggers an alert email and stops. (In case of
#      accidental deletions, you have the opportunity to recover them from
#      the existing parity info. This also mitigates to a degree encryption malware.)
#   4) If partiy info is out of sync, AND the number of deleted or changed files exceed X
#      AND it has reached/exceeded Y (configurable) number of warnings, force
#      a sync. (Useful when you get a false alarm above and you can't be bothered
#      to login and do a manual sync. Note the risk is if its not a false alarm
#      and you can't access the box before Y number of times the job is run  to
#      fix the issue... Well I hope you have other backups...)
#   5) If parity info is out of sync BUT the number of deleted files did NOT
#      exceed X, it calls sync to update the parity info.
#   6) If the parity info is in sync (either because nothing changed or after it
#      has successfully completed the sync job, it runs the scrub command to
#      validate the integrity of the data (both the files and the parity info).
#      Note that each run of the scrub command will validate only a (configurable)
#      portion of parity info to avoid having a long running job and affecting
#      the performance of the box.
#   7) Once all jobs are completed, it sends an email with the output to user
#      (if configured).
